Pune is an historic city closely related to the rise of the Maratha Empire in the 17th Century and fondly remembered as the birthplace of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. For me, this trip was not just about history, it became the backdrop of one of the most meaningful academic journeys of my undergrad years.


## VLSID 2026: From Delegate to Author
The journey to Pune started right on New Year's morning with a 28 hour train ride across the country. Reaching Pune, we were given accomodation in one of the most happenning places in the city, that is Fergusson College Road.

VLSID presented a rich tapestry of progress in the domain of VLSI across in the country, and is regarded as the poster-child of India's semicondutor dreams. It was quite a spectacle as distinguished guests and dignitaries around the world had come to give byte sized lectures accessible to everyone.

It was my first time presenting my work at a conference and that too an oral presentation! It was a daunting task to speak well enough in front of Professors, Professionals and PhDs from around the country and abroad, all the while doing justice to our work. The response to my relief and delight, was very positive and more encouraging than I had expected. One CEO of a startup even approached me with the proposal of intergrating my work in his tech stack! There could be no greater validation than this.

All in all, the experience was very reflective as just over 2 years ago, attending VLSID as a student is what exposed me the world of VLSI and got me interested in Silicon in Chip, Digital Circuits and what not... It was a quiet full circle moment.

## Riding Through Pune’s Historic Heart
Visiting Pune without an immersing in its culture would be a great miss, so on the final day of the conference after the closing, we grabbed our bikes and set out on a ride across the city. Our first stop was Lal Mahal, the historic residence closely associated with the childhood of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Next was Shaniwar Wada, a palace-fort which was an important seat of power for the Peshwas. In its prime it housed a seven storey palace and was surronded by lush gardens. Sadly now, only its walls and foundations remain as a great fire in 1828 destroyed much of the palace.

## Curves, Ghats and Lonavala
After exploring a bit of the city, to ultilise the remaining time we had, we decided to do a late night ride to and from Lonavala. Although we could not spend the night, the primary motivation was to enjoy the curvy roads, the ghats and the thrilling rush of cool air across your face.

## More Ghats and a Fort to Finish!
With our flights scheduled in the evening, the most time-optimal strategy of another ride early morning was selected. This time our destination was Singhagad Fort. This fort, perched atop the Sahadri Mountains, presented a stunning panoramic view of the valley below. The early morning ride winding through the ghats along with the stunning views from the fort, was one of the most memorable part of the whole trip.

## Looking Back
Pune managed to leave a lasting imprint on me. It was a rare convergence of academic growth and lived experience presenting my work, and then stepping out into a city layered with history, culture and winding roads. From lecture halls and poster sessions to midnight rides through the ghats and sunrise at Sinhagad, every moment felt purposeful. I returned not just with memories of a journey, but with a renewed sense of direction and quietly excited for all the roads that still lie ahead.
